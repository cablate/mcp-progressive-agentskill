## Design Intent

### Proven AgentSkills Pattern

In the AgentSkills.io ecosystem, **Progressive Disclosure** combined with **Script linkage** has been validated as effective:

- AI only loads specific information when needed, significantly reducing token usage
- Scripts can be invoked via AI commands, providing high customization potential
- Sharing tools via scripts is far less costly than developing and using complex MCP Servers

The impact of this pattern is **significant and substantial**.

### Current MCP Skill Dilemma

Despite this, many Skills using MCP still face two extreme options:

**Option 1: Install MCP directly in Claude Code, Skill only guides AI to call MCP**
- MCP server occupies AI context long-term
- Full tool list loaded every conversation
- Token waste, and MCP itself cannot be progressively explored

**Option 2: Write custom scripts yourself**
- Tests user's programming skills
- High customization but lacks standards
- Each MCP has its own format/specs, high adaptation cost for both open and closed source
- Difficult to maintain and share

### This Skill's Goal

**Validate whether AgentSkills.io pattern applies to improving MCP usage**

This concept validation attempts to port AgentSkills' successful pattern to the MCP domain:

1. Can AgentSkills architecture apply to MCP server management?
2. Is three-layer progressive disclosure effective in MCP scenarios?
3. Is Socket-based daemon architecture more practical than direct MCP usage?

### Experimental Nature

This is not a mature product, but an experiment:

- Test AgentSkills pattern applicability in MCP domain
- Explore actual effectiveness of three-layer loading
- Validate pros/cons of Daemon architecture
- Serve as reference prototype for future development

### Important Disclaimer

**This is a very early, rushed AI-assisted demo version** with current goals:

- Validate concept feasibility
- Explore usage patterns
- Collect feedback for improvements

**Not recommended for production use**.
Expect many issues and optimization opportunities. If you find any problems or have suggestions, please open an Issue or contribute a PR.

## Core Concepts

### Three-Layer Progressive Disclosure

Like AgentSkills, you don't need to load everything at once:

**Layer 1: Know which servers are available**
```
Load only basic info (name, version, status)
Usage: ~50-100 tokens
Use case: Check availability, choose server
```

**Layer 2: Know what tools this server provides**
```
Load tool list (names + brief descriptions)
Usage: ~200-400 tokens
Use case: Browse available tools, decide what to use
```

**Layer 3: Load only the tools you need**
```
Load complete input format for specific tool
Usage: ~300-500 tokens/tool
Use case: Before calling tool
```

### Why This Approach

Assume an MCP server has 20 tools, you only need 2:

| Loading Method | Token Usage | Description |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| Load All | 6,000 | 20 tools × 300 tokens |
| Three-Layer Progressive | 850 | Metadata(50) + List(200) + 2 tools(600) |
| Savings | 86% | Only load what you need |

## Development Status

### Future Plans

Based on concept validation results, future directions include:

**Short-term Goals**
- More convenient MCP Servers management (UI, auto-discovery, one-click install)
- Implement Auth features (API Key management, permission control)

**Mid-term Goals**
- Enhance MCP Server tool calling experience (better error messages, parameter validation, result formatting)
- Intercept MCP Server output with customizable Script data processing, avoid massive messy data entering conversation memory

This project's direction depends on:

- Concept validation results
- Community feedback
- Actual usage needs

Feedback and suggestions welcome.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm

### 1. Install from npm (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @cablate/agentic-mcp

# Verify installation
agentic-mcp --version

# Start daemon
agentic-mcp daemon start
```

### 2. Configure

Edit `mcp-servers.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "playwright": {
      "description": "Browser automation tool for web navigation, screenshots, clicks, form filling, and more",
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--isolated"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Start Daemon

```bash
node dist/cli/index.js daemon start --config <config-path>
```

### 4. Test Connection

```bash
# Check daemon health
agentic-mcp daemon health

# Layer 1: Check server status
agentic-mcp metadata playwright

# Layer 2: List available tools
agentic-mcp list playwright

# Layer 3: View specific tool format
agentic-mcp schema playwright browser_navigate
```

### 5. Call Tool

```bash
agentic-mcp call playwright browser_navigate --params '{"url": "https://example.com"}'
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Web Automation

Automate browser operations using Playwright MCP server:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to website
agentic-mcp call playwright browser_navigate --params '{"url": "https://www.apple.com/tw"}'

# 2. Take screenshot
agentic-mcp call playwright browser_take_screenshot

# 3. Click element
agentic-mcp call playwright browser_click --params '{"element": "Mac link", "ref": "e19"}'
```

### Hot Reload Configuration

Reload after modifying `mcp-servers.json` without restarting daemon:

```bash
agentic-mcp daemon reload
```

Response example:

```
✓ Configuration reloaded
  Old servers: playwright_global
  New servers: playwright_global, filesystem_global
```

## Configuration

### MCP Servers Configuration

Edit `mcp-servers.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "playwright": {
      "description": "Browser automation tool for web navigation, screenshots, clicks, and form filling",
      "transportType": "stdio",

```

**Configuration Notes**:
- `description` (optional): Server description for AI to understand the MCP server's purpose. If not provided, Layer 1 metadata will not include this field.
